###11/07/2016I used texture mapping on this project for the background. The image was retrieved from this website[Background](http://cdn.allwallpaper.in/wallpapers/1920x1509/15794/3d-abstract-artwork-design-tunnels-1920x1509-wallpaper.jpg)The picture was cut into 6 small pieces with same dimensions. Texture mapping is used to apply these images to 6 faces of the cubeâ€™s background.The following snippets of code is about using texture mapping in my project. ```htmlvar textureCube = new THREE.CubeTextureLoader()					.setPath( 'texture/')				.load( ['phai1.jpg','trai1.jpg', 'tren1.jpg', 'duoi1.jpg', 'truoc1.jpg', 'duoi1.jpg' ] );				scene.background = textureCube;```
I also used transparency method for my little mickey mouse object .
###This is link to my video [Assignment3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5sCPxBrglU)I found this example at [Bridge]( https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_envmaps)I like the background texture mapping, and how realistic background look. I like the way that the author designed on the background. It is really hard to see the boarder line between faces. I also like the reflection of the bridge on a sphere. The author added a second camera at the specific position whose surfaces should be reflective in sphere, then create a material and set the environment map as the result of rendering from the second camera.
